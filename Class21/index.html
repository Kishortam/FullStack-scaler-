        JavaScript uses strict or No-Strict mode.

        'use strict' : it show strictness in JS

        JS execution in window & node differs.

        in non-strict mode either it points to window or object.

        strict mode is to avoid basic mistakes.

        non-strict in browser:
        => if object is present, refer to object
        => if object is not present, refer to window

        strict mode in browser:
        => if object is present, refer to object
        => if object is not present, refer to undefined not window

        non-strict in node:
        => if object is present, refer to object
        => if object is not present, refer to global

        strict mode in node:
        => if object is present, refer to object
        => if object is not present, refer to global not window

        This => reference to object

        call/apply => call/apply to change object reference
        => execute function
        => call takes spreaded arguments
        => apply takes array of arguments

        bind => bind a function with an object
        => returns a binded function
